Instructions
====================

Through the ten weeks you are at BU, we will introduce some useful programming tools and skills during six weekly programming workshop sessions.  These include skills on using linux, the BU shared computing cluster (SCC), sharing your code and work on github using git, coding with R and Python, machine learning software, and the SQL database language. The sessions will have two parts, a 1 hour offline document or video that you study prior to attending the session and 2 hours hands-on session during which we will walk you through different commands and programs.

In order to participate, you will need to install the required tools and applications prior to coming to the classes. Below are the instructions to install an SSH Client, git, R and RStudio, Python and anaconda, RapidMiner, and mySQL. Please have them ready and running on your laptops so we can make the most out of the sessions. These instructions have been tested, but itâ€™s not possible for us to run through all the installation steps for all operating systems.  If you encounter a problem or need more clarification, please make a note and send it to us, or write up your own modification of these instructions.  In case you have any difficulty, please contact us to fix any potential problems before the specific sessions start.
